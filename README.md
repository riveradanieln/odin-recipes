# odin-recipes

Hello! Daniel, here.

Within these pages you will find two personal recipes that I enjoy and consume regularly along with a standard recipe for one of my favorite desserts.

This project combines many of the beginning concepts I've learned so far such as generating standard html boilerplate and understanding basic elements like images, links, and lists. 

I've also learned about key attributes such as alt text for an image and how to change the properties of an element.

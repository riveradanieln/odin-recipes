    <h2 class="description title">Description</h2>
    <p class="description body">The idea behind this meal was that I was feeling deathly ill and I needed
        somthing somewhat hot that could be thrown together. I was craving ginger
        at the time so this is what came of that. The key to this recipe is 
        throwing any amount of ingredients into a pot of water and add salt.
